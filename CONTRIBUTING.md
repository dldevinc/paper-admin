## Development

#### Setup

    pip install -e .
    yarn install

#### Pre-Commit Hooks

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to simplify linting
and ensure consistent formatting among contributors. Use of `pre-commit`
is not a requirement, but is highly recommended.

```shell
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Commiting will now automatically run the local hooks and ensure that
your commit passes all lint checks.
